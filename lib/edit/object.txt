# N: serial number : & object name~
# G: symbol : color
# I: tval : sval : pval
# W: depth : rarity : weight : cost
# P: plus to-hit : damage dice : plus to-evasion : protection dice
# A: depth/rarity : depth/rarity : etc
# F: flag | flag | etc
# D: description
#
# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
#     increase for each new item. The '&' and '~' symbols are use to
#     include articles and pluralization as necessary to ensure
#     grammatical correctness in object descriptions.
#
# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 15 colors, as
#     follows:
#
#     D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
#     r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
#     W - Light Gray   v - Violet         y - Yellow        R - Light Red
#     G - Light Green  B - Light Blue     U - Light Brown
#     d - 'flavoured' items
#
# 'I' is for basic information. The tval is for the type of item, the
#     sval identifies the subtype and the pval indicates the amount of
#     effect the item has, if applicable (a fixed value: variable pvals
#     are currently hard-coded.) 
#
# 'W' is for extra information. Depth is the depth the object is normally
#     found at (and defines what 'level' the object is, when determining how easy 
#     it is to use a wand, staff or rod, rarity determines how common the object
#     is (currently unused, thanks to the A: allocation lines), weight is in
#     tenth-pounds and cost is the item's base value.
#
# 'P' is for power information. The item's bonuses to attack and evasion
#     as well as its damage and protection dice. Note that adding damage dice to
#     armor won't aid your attacks, it will just set the damage done when it is thrown.
#
# 'A' is for allocation - depth and rarity, in pairs. This allows an
#     item to have multiple natural depths and rarities. It is used to
#     ensure that certain vital items such as food and identify scrolls
#     are found throughout the dungeon. The 'allocation' depth need not
#     match the depth as specified in the 'W:' line.
#
# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
#     lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
#     are separated by the '|' symbol.
#
# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
#     to describe the object. Note that lines will need spaces at their
#     ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
#     together.

##### The 'Special Artifacts' #####
#
# These objects do not specify 'full names' because the artifact name
# is added in 'obj-desc.c' based on the artifact index ('i_ptr->name1').
#
# These objects do specify a 'base name, which is used when the object
# is 'aware' (always true for lites)
#
# They specify 'physical colors', which
# over-ride the 'flavor' colors, if any. 
#
# Note that ALL artifacts are given 'IGNORE_ALL',
# so we do not need to specify that here.
#
# Note that the 'INSTA_ART' flag is used to prevent these objects from
# being created without also turning them into artifacts.  This flag
# must be specified both here and in the artifact template.
#
# The reason for having multiple 'ring' and
# 'amulet' templates is to allow each 'special artifact' to
# have a different 'color' and 'flavor', and also to allow the use of
# special 'base names' (such as 'Necklace').


# The Ring of Barahir
#
# The word 'Serpentine' should be just a flavor,
# but I can get it to work like that yet.
# Putting it here works almost as well.

D:You have found a shortsword. Note that it is listed as a Shortsword
D: (+0, 1d7) [+1]. The numbers given in round brackets are attack values
D: and those in square brackets are defence. This shortsword gives no
D: bonus to hit, does a single seven sided die of damage, and gives a
D: +1 bonus to evasion. In contrast, your curved sword has -1 to attack
D: and does two five sided dice of damage, and the same bonus to evasion.
D:                                 
D: This shortsword is also marked {special}. This means that it bears some
D: unknown enchantment. You will have to discover what that is. For now
D: try wielding it (u).

D:Here is a set of Gauntlets (-1) [+0, 1d1]. This means that they
D: give a penalty of -1 to your attacks, they have no bonus to evasion
D: and they absorb 1 point of damage (a one sided die worth...).
D: In contrast, your Leather Armour [-1, 1d4] has a -1 penalty to evasion
D: and absorbs one four sided die of damage.
D:                                           As you can see, armour and
D: weapons in Sil come with trade-offs between attack (chance of hitting;
D: damage), and defence (chance of evading hits; damage reduction).
D: Which pieces of equipment are best will depend on the circumstances.
