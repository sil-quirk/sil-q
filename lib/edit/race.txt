D: of spirit that they can endure vast hardship. Their

D:The Sindar are the 'Grey-elves' who never saw the blessed light of
D: the Two Trees, but who found an echo of it in their queen,
D: Melian the Maiar. They are less learned and powerful than the
D: Noldor, but have fair voices and are gifted in song.

D:The dwarves are stone-hard and stubborn, fast in friendship
D: and in enmity. They live long, far beyond the span of Men
D: but not for ever. They are short in stature, deep-breasted
D: and stout in the leg, and their beards are long. They were
D: named the 'Naugrim' by the Sindar, meaning 'the stunted people'.

D:The Edain are the Men of Beleriand. They gained much from
D: dealings with the Noldor, and grew more long lived than their
D: kin beyond the mountains.
D: However, compared to the elves they were more frail, and more easily
D: slain by weapon or mischance.
D: The Edain dwell in the north of
D: Beleriand and help the Noldor to contain Morgoth's power.
