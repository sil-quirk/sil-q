# N: serial number : monster name
# W: depth : rarity
# G: symbol : color
# I: speed : health : mana : light radius
# A: sleepiness : perception : stealth : will
# P: [evasion bonus, protection dice]
# B: attack method : attack effect : (attack bonus, damage dice)
# S: spell frequency | spell power
# S: spell type | spell type | etc
# F: flag | flag | etc
# D: Description
#
# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
#     increase for each new item. Entry 0 is used for the player.
#
# 'W' is for more information - the depth they are found at and their rarity
#     (they have a 1 in rarity chance of being generated).
#
# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 16 colors, as
#     follows:
#
#     D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
#     r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
#     d - Black        W - Light Gray     v - Violet        y - Yellow
#     R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown
#
#     Note that black is the same color as the screen background, and
#     thus the monster will appear to be an empty black space if its
#     color is d.
#
# 'I' is for information - speed, health, light radius in squares.
#
# 'A' is for alertness - their maximum sleep value, their perception score, 
#     their stealth score, and their will score.
#
# 'P' is protection - the evasion bonus and protection dice
#
# 'B' is for blows - method of attack, effect of attack, and damage
#     from attack. There may be up to four of these lines; effect and
#     damage are optional.
#
# 'S' is for spells. The first S: line must be S:SPELL_PCT_X with X the
#     percentage chance of casting each turn. X must not be zero. If X is 100,
#     the monster will
#     never move while the player is in sight, and will thus never attack
#     in melee, as it will cast spells every turn: if the monster is to use
#     a melee attack, then X must be 2 or greater.  Power determines the 
#     damage and intensity of the attacks.  The format is POW_X with X 
#     being the spell power.
#
# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many F:
#     lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags and flags
#     are separated by the '|' symbol.
#
# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
#     to describe the monster.
#
#
#
# === Understanding monster.txt flags ===
#
# UNIQUE monsters are just special monster races, with the requirement
# that only one monster of that race can exist at a time, and when it is
# killed, it can never again be generated.
#
# ATTR_CLEAR monsters appear the same color as the floor, terrain feature or
# object underneath them.
#
# ATTR_MULTI monsters are multi - hued - they change color, every player turn.
#
# CHAR_CLEAR monsters are totally invisible: the symbol shown on the screen
# is the same as the floor (or other terrain feature) below it, or the item
# that is lying on that floor. These monsters can currently be targetted as
# normal monsters: perhaps this can be changed so that the player must KNOW
# the monster is there (by bumping into it, or having the monster wake up
# and attack the player?)
#
# CHAR_MULTI monsters are those which look like objects, and use the symbols
# of objects. They are in plain sight, but the character should not know that
# a monster is there. At the moment, such monsters can be targetted normally
# (which means that this flag currently has no effect), but this may change
# in the future, as with CHAR_CLEAR monsters.
#
# (Note that currently both CHAR_CLEAR and CHAR_MULTI monsters are treated
# as normal monsters that are just a little hard to see... if you look
# for them, you will find them unless they are invisible and you cannot
# see invisible, and if you use the * command for targetting mode you
# can pick them as a target.)
