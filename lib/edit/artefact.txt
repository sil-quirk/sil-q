# File: artefact.txt
#
# This file is used to create the 'lib/data/artefact.raw' file, which
# is used to initialize the 'artefact' information for Sil.
#
# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.
#
#
# === Understanding artefact.txt ===
#
# N: serial number : item name
# G: char : attr
# I: tval : sval : pval
# B: skilltype / abilitynum : ...
# W: depth : rarity : weight : cost
# P: attack bonus : damage dice : evasion bonus : protection dice
# F: flag | flag | etc
# D: text
#
# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
#     increase for each new item.
#
# 'G' is for graphics overrides, if any. The char is the symbol 
#     and the attr the colour. (See object.txt)
#
# 'I' is for basic information. The tval is for the type of item, the
#     sval identifies the subtype and the pval indicates the amount of
#     effect the item has, if applicable.
#     (See object.txt)
#
# 'B' is for granted abilities, represented as pairs of skill 
#     numbers and ability numbers. (See ability.txt)
#
# 'W' is for extra information. Depth is the depth the object is
#     normally found at, rarity determines how common the object is,
#     weight is in tenth-pounds and cost is the item's value.
#
# 'P' is for power information. The item's bonuses to attack and
#     evasion, as well as its damage and protection dice.
#     Note that for non-weapons, adding damage dice will not
#     help with melee, only with the thrown damage.
#
# 'F' is for flags. These are fairly self-explanatory. As many 
#     F: lines may be used as are needed to specify all the flags
#     and flags are separated by the '|' symbol.
#
# 'D' is a textual description of the artefact.
# 
# === Important Notes ===
#
# (1) The artefact indexes are defined in 'defines.h', and must not be changed.
#
# (2) Any changes or additions to the file will have influence on randarts
#     and may break savefile compatibility for old savegames with randarts.  If
#     using random artefacts, finish your existing game before making any
#     changes to the artefact.txt file at all.
#
# (3) Removing any artefact, or changing its 'base' type (as defined by
#     the tval and sval entries in the 'I:' line), will break savefile
#     compatibility for ALL savefiles.
#
# (4) Adding a new artefact, or changing the powers of existing ones, will
#     NOT affect savefile compatibility for games with the standard artefact set:
#     it is perfectly safe to do this. (If your new artefact is a new kind of
#     object, or a new one at the end of the file, you must also amend object.txt
#     or limits.txt.)
#
#
#
# === Ideas for Artefacts ===
#
# Regarding the dating and cut-offs for the items, Beren and Luthien stole a
# Silmaril in FA 469, so I'd like to keep roughly to this date.
