- Sil 1.3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- broke savefile compatibility
	- sorry about this
	- it needs to happen every now and then and I schedule it for the 1.X.0 releases

- monsters
	- large changes to the early game monsters
		- many new monsters
		- replaced many of the more generic early monsters as many players had requested
		- a few changes to some later game monsters
	- stopped the Orc warrior "chain charging"
		- it used to be that swapping with another orc counted as movement, setting up a charge
		- it no longer does (in line with how the player abilities work)
		- also anything that makes them skip a turn interrupts their charging
			- (such as when they become aware of you)
	- Gave Boldog resistance to fear (from his spear)

- new mac version
	- replaced the old Carbon version with a Cocoa version
	- the old version was really out of date and wouldn't compile or run on recent systems
	- this should also remove some stubborn old bugs (see bugfixes)
	- this version isnâ€™t perfect (e.g. some minor problems with displaying text)
		- but it does allow Sil to run on all new systems

- objects
	- horns
		- no longer require a will check to use
		- this is because they all require a will check to have an effect anyway

- abilities
	- made Leaping easier to acquire
		- it no longer has a pre-requisite
		- it now acts as a pre-requisite to Sprinting
	- Channelling now halves the voice cost for blowing horns

- smithing
	- now allows artefact rings to have bonuses to attack, evasion, and protection
		- (since there are regular rings with these)
	- removed the ability to add Grace to artefact cloaks
		- (just a minor nerf to the extreme +Grace smiths)

- tunnelling
	- attempting to tunnel but failing now takes a turn if you are confused
		- otherwise control-dir in a corridor would effectively overcome confusion

- bugfixes
	- stopped Great Cold-Drakes and Scatha the Worm having radius 40 light (!)
	- fixed the 'could not find a vault at 100ft depth' bug
	- control-t no longer aims successfully for throwing while confused
	- smithing gloves of treachery now correctly forces a <-1> penalty to strength
	- now correctly displays 'cut' status on the first turn on a new dungeon level
	- fixed a bug where channeling's +5 bonus didn't apply to horns of force
	- hopefully fixed various bugs with the Mac version
		- crash on startup
		- requiring admin password sometimes when opening saved games


- Sil 1.2.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- monster songs
	- made Morgoth's Song of Piercing a bit easier to resist (+5 bonus)
	- fixed Morgoth's Song score to 20
		- it no longer increases by 5 when his crown comes off like his Will does
	- the Song of Silence now reduces monsters' Song Score by a quarter of the Player's Song Score

- abilities
	- reworked some of the pre-requisites for the Will Abilities
		- notably Hardiness is less essential and Constitution is a bit harder to get
	- added Parry as an alternate pre-req for Two Weapon Fighting
	- increased the Song skill requirement for the point of Grace from 13 to 15

- smithing
	- you can now try out creating any item without the required smithing abilities
		- things that you can't do without an additional ability are shown in red
	- there are no known bugs with smithing remaining
	- modified the stat costs for horns (used to all cost grace)

- dungeon generation
	- significantly more flexibility in vault generation
		- vaults can now appear rotated as well as reflected
		- vaults now can have flags for extra traps, webs, rotation, debugging
	- improved trap placement
		- now much more likely to appear in interesting places
		- so it can now be worth actually searching for them in some cases
	- chasms can no longer be generated before 150 ft 
		- (to make sure you can get to the guaranteed forge!)
	- halved the chance of locked doors
		- now 8% of all doors are locked, 4% are jammed

- dungeon features
	- chasms
		- staffs of freedom and song of freedom can now close chasms
			- but the difficulty is extremely high: 
				- 20 + number of adjacent chasm squares for the staff
				- 25 + number of adjacent chasm squares for the song
			- it therefore tends to close in from the edges
	- secret doors
		- tunnelling into them now gives you a (random) closed door instead of a broken door
		- to avoid it sometimes being better to not find a secret door than to find it
	- broken doors
		- changed their symbol to '.', so they are more distinct from open doors and less confusing

- objects
	- made herbs of restoration a bit more common early

- artefacts
	- made the new mithril artefacts (Starlight and Silverhand) more rare (as originally intended)

- bugfixes
	- fixed two smithing bugs
		- one had to do with re-choosing an enchantment after modifying the numbers
		- one had to do with abilities disappearing or duplicating on artefacts
	- fixed a terrible bug with the monster ability 'Exchange Places' 
		- which could cause you to be sent out of the dungeon if you killed the cat warrior who was exchanging
	- removed one of the messages when automatically picking up a thrown/fired item
	- fixed a bug where cancelling some but not all free attacks with a '!a' weapon didn't use up any time
	- fixed a bug where Woven Themes was having the effect of the removed ability Unwavering Voice
	- players were (again) getting the Opportunist free attack when an enemy was pushed with Knock Back
	- no longer takes any time to tunnel if you aren't going to be successful
		- i.e. it is more like realising you can't, than like trying and failing
	- fleeing monsters can no longer get free attacks of any kind
	- monsters that are frozen by song of mastery no longer get free attacks of any kind
	- can now automatically identify the Ring of Barahir (and perhaps others) by the Ability it grants


- Sil 1.2.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- broke savefile compatibility
	- sorry about this
	- it needs to happen every now and then and I schedule it for the 1.X.0 releases

- many of the small improvements in this version are from the Sil variant: mpa-sil
	- I've noted this below where I remember -- apologies for those I've forgotten to credit

- monster abilities
	- monsters can now have some of the abilities that the player can get
		- such as Charge, Cruel Blow, etc.
	- Morgoth and Gorthaur have songs of power

- added chasms to the dungeon
	- these block movement of you and most enemies, but not sight or line of fire

- added a player AI inspired by the Angband Borg
	- called the 'automaton'
	- it serves no real purpose, but people might want to try experimenting with its code and parameters
		- and see how deep they can get it to go

- abilities
	- Throwing Mastery now prevents thrown items from breaking
	- Two Weapon Fighting no longer allows you to wield 'hand and a half' weapons in your off-hand
	- Knock Back
		- now requires there to be no monster in the square the creature is knocked into
			- so orcs don't get swapped in corridors etc
		- it now takes weapon weight into account in determining your effective strength
			- so you will want a heavy enough weapon to get your full strength bonus
	- Point Blank Shot now completely prevents the attack of opportunity from the
	  enemy you just shot at, instead of 50% chance for all adjacent enemies
	- Skill requirements reduced on several early Evasion Abilities
	- Added the Evasion Ability: Leaping 
	- Flanking no longer requires Dodging (though the latter still works well with it)
	- Heavy Armour use now has an alternative pre-requisite of Crowd Fighting
	- Lore-master no longer identifies chest traps (via mpa-sil)
	- Majesty now takes the monster's Will into account
		- instead of reducing morale by Will/4...
		- it reduces it by half the difference between your Will and theirs
	- Song of Sharpness now lowers enemy protection by 2% per point of Song
		- this is usually a smaller effect than the old rules
	- Song of Mastery is now slightly cheaper to make the skill point progression simpler
	- Unwavering Voice has been removed
		- having non-song abilities in the Song tree limits the ability for people to learn many songs
		- and this was the weakest one in terms of game mechanics
	- Woven Themes now makes the minor theme use (Song / 2) instead of (Song - 5)
		- this makes it worse in most cases
		- but this means more people will use Song abilities to get actual songs
		- made slightly more expensive to make the skill point progression simpler

- smithing
	- can now create horns using 'Jeweller'
	- the difficulties of making mithril items have been reduced a lot
	- 'slays' no longer cost a strength point to add to a weapon
		- it was too steep a cost for the early game, making no-one add them
	- artefact arrows now have half the difficulty
		- it was crazy costing you as much for 1 arrow as for 24 or a regular equipment piece
	- fixed several of the smithing bugs
		- the game is now clear that you can only use one of Enchant or Artifice per item
			- this removes the worst smithing bugs
		- fixed a bug with artefact rings and amulets forgetting their special bonuses sometimes
		- I think the only remaining bugs are glitches surrounding abilities on artefacts disappearing or duplicating
			- the work around is to only add abilities to artefacts immediately before the end

- items
	- weights	
		- randomised weights for weapons and armour are now less fine grained (via mpa-sil)
			- they come in multiples of 0.5 lb instead of 0.1 lb
		- other weights tweaked a bit to match (e.g. potions from 0.4 lb to 0.5 lb)
	- increased chance of generating out of depth items from 1 in 10 to 1 in 7
	- identification
		- there is no longer a perception check when identifying items by use 
			- (you automatically pass if you get the opportunity)
		- identification of passive abilities now occurs twice as quickly
	- reduced the late game frequencies of many potions/herbs
		- people typically had far too many of them by the throne room
	- horns
		- changed trumpets to horns
			- changed colours, descriptions, adjectives
			- dramatically reduced weight
		- added the Horn of Force, which knocks back enemies in its path
	- vampiric weapons no longer drain life from nonliving monsters
	- herbs of rage
		- now make you completely immune to fear
			- previously it was just resistance, but the possibility of frightened rage was silly
		- you can no longer identify monsters via the recall window
	- staffs of treasures now display non-subdued Deathblades
	- bows
		- Shortbows now native to 50 ft instead of 100 ft
			- so archers should be a bit easier to start
		- Longbows
			- now native to 150 ft instead of 350 ft
				- to give players a better choice of archery style through the game
			- no longer get the [-1] penalty
				- it was a bit fiddly and too few archers were using them anyway
		- Dragon-horn Bows are now 1d9 2.0lb
			- a bit like deathblades or the old longbows
			- they should be more tempting to the majority of archers who find them now
	- throwing items (daggers, spears, throwing axes)
		- now found in slightly larger stacks
		- removed some of the special item types they could get that required wielding
		- made an automatic throwing command: control-t
			- throws the first throwing item in your inventory at your target or closest monster
			- akin to "ff"
	- artefacts
		- made the Greatsword of Saithnar a bit less good
		- made the Shortsword of Galadriel rarer
		- tweaked the stats of the Helm of Curufin
			- it had (-1) instead of [-1] only because 5 years ago that was how all helms were...
		- the Cloak of Maglor now grants Song of the Trees
			- as Unwavering Voice was removed

- display
	- molds are now always visible once sighted for the first time (via mpa-sil?)
	- made the darkest shade of grey (d1) a bit darker
		- needed to tell it apart more clearly from the others
	- visual display of hits on monsters changed
		- there is no longer a colour difference when doing more than 10 damage
		- instead, there is a colour difference when killing an opponent
	- significantly improved the self knowledge screen to show the quantitative effects
		- including the details of stacked levels of an attribute
		- now also identifies items if the item granting the power is known
			- (e.g. slay orc on melee weapon) (via mpa-sil)
	- weapon and armour weights are now shown when you walk over them (via mpa-sil?)
	- gave more detail in the in-game descriptions of some abilities (via mpa-sil)
	- if you are in a pit or web, this is now displayed in the status line
	- adjusted the 'notes' display
		- to let it fit slightly longer notes
		- and changed self-made notes so that the last few words don't automatically flow to the next line
			- which makes it easier to manually write long multi-line notes without looking ragged
	- falls now correctly display the character of the thing that made you fall in the combat rolls window
		- e.g. the staircase or the false floor
	- abbreviate "Health" and "Voice" when you have more than 100 points of it (via mpa-sil)

- interface
	- removed "always pickup" and "prompt before picking things up" options
		- the former let you get free turns and wasn't really any easier than manual pickup
			- (since you want to pick up less than half of things and need a keystroke either way)
		- the latter was only needed with the former
	- added an user interface option to 'Forgo bonus attacks on unwary enemies'
		- this used to be always on, but can now be toggled
		- I've made sure it covers *all* bonus attacks (I'd missed Rapid Fire and maybe another)
	- targetting
		- firing an arrow 'ff' when the target is a location that is now out of line of fire, no longer fires
		- added an automatic throwing command that throws the first throwing item in inventory at the first target
		- both firing and throwing no longer automatically choose a target if it is out of range
	- you can now inscribe your melee weapon with "!a" somewhere in the inscription (via mpa-sil?)
		- this will trigger a warning every time you try to attack with it
		- good for pacifists, extreme stealth characters, and smithing equipment
	- you will also be similarly warned if trying to attack with a shovel or bare-handed
	- monster memory now explains that touch attacks ignore armour
	- you are notified when entering greater vaults (via mpa-sil)

- monsters
	- unified how monster mana works
		- they each have a capacity of 15 points of 'mana'
		- it regenerates 1 point per round (if not singing)
		- casting a spell uses 10
		- starting a song uses 1 per round 
			- and monsters only decide to start if they have at least 10
	- made the check for monsters to bash down doors the same as for the player
		- I don't know how this had got out of sync
		- it is now easier for monsters to bash doors
	- allowed weaker monsters to rarely (1 in 10) push past stronger ones
		- necessary for the new pathfinding code
	- orc warriors
		- now come in smaller groups
		- also have the Ability 'Charge'
	- easterlings
		- easterling archers
			- their longbows now do 2d7 instead of the old-fashioned 1d11
		- easterling warriors
			- have the Ability 'Flanking'
		- Uldor, the Accursed is now an archer rather than a melee specialist
			- makes him more different, and good to have an archer unique
			- has the Ability 'Crippling Shot'
		- Ulfang, the Black
			- has the Ability 'Opportunist'
		- Maeglin
			- has the Ability 'Riposte'
	- cats
		- cat warriors
			- have the Ability 'Exchange Places'
		- Tevildo
			- has the Ability 'Cruel Blow'
			- and has melee reduced a little to compensate
	- trolls
		- all types have the Ability 'Knock Back'
		- Dagorhir, the Elfbane
			- now has the Ability 'Elf-Bane'
			- his base att/evn was lowered a bit to compensate
	- worm masses
		- now become unwary properly when you are far enough away (like other monsters)
		- since they don't breed when unwary, this should help with worm mass explosions
		- their crawl attacks no longer halve your armour (unneeded complexity)
			- but I've slightly increased damage to partially compensate
	- raukar
		- sulraukar are now easier to kill
			- reduced evasion and protection
		- ringraukar
			- increased damage
		- kemenraukar
			- reduced evasion
			- adjusted their AI slightly to weakly prefer open space to breaking through a wall
	- shadow spiders
		- reduced health (slightly), evasion, and melee
		- they seemed to be a bit too tough, but you will still want to remember to run away!
	- Thuringwethil is now coloured red to make her more distinct
	- Gorthaur
		- has gained a Song
	- Morgoth
		- has gained two Songs
		- and a point of Con to make him slightly more resilient

- vaults
	- added many new vaults, including many designed by Clouded and some by HallucinationMushroom (from the Forum)
	- made vaults a little more common, including earlier in the dungeon
	- removed iron walls (a.k.a. permanent rock)
		- it wasn't really needed and we weren't doing anything interesting with it

- traps
	- removed amnesia gas traps due to player frustration
	- removed flame traps from chests as they just encouraged dropping your flammable goods (via mpa-sil)

- other
	- digging
		- you no longer need to be wielding a digger to dig with it
			- carrying it in your backpack is enough
			- this saves some turns (and tedium) when digging
			- but to balance this digging now provokes attacks of opportunity from adjacent enemies (like archery)
		- the strength requirements have been changed (via mpa-sil)
			- you now need Str 1 to clear rubble, Str 2 to break quartz, and Str 3 to break granite
			- it no longer depends upon the digger weight (as there was no clean way to do so)
	- stealth
		- reduced the difficulty of having monsters lose track of you (become unwary again)
			- previously you had to beat them at their perception roll by 30
			- now it is by 25
			- Vanish still give +10 to this roll
		- passing the turn in stealth mode doesn't suffer the speed penalty
			- so it is no longer advantageous to toggle stealth mode on and off if you want to pass
			- the word 'slow' is still displayed but that relates to the next action, not the last one
	- unified and clarified the stacking behaviour of numerous effects on the player and monsters
		- almost everything that can stack, does stack
			- all temporary effects (except entrancement): add new duration to the existing duration
			- speed: stacks but the final score is limited to be between 1 and 3
			- elemental resistances: x levels of (net) resistance means damage/x
			                         x levels of (net) vulnerability means damage*x
			- sustains: +10x bonus to Will check
			- resist fear, blindness, confusion, stun, hallucination: +10x bonus to Will check
			- free action: +10x bonus to Will check
			- see invisible: +10x bonus to Perception check
			- aggravate: unwary monsters get +10x to perception check
			- regeneration: your regeneration rate is (1 + x) times normal
			- danger: monsters are generated as x levels deeper
			- cowardice: damage threshold to trigger fear is 10/x
			- haunted: x% chance per turn of generating a wraith
			- hunger: each level triples the rate, each level of slow digestion divides it by three.
			- sharpness: Amount from song (song*2 %) is added to amount from weapon (0%, 50%, or 100%)
			- slays/brands: each valid one adds a die of damage
			- light: your equipment levels add up to produce your light radius
				- light from sources on the floor, or monsters, or lit rooms, add their light levels on that square
		- things that don't stack
			- tunnelling: you tunnel with the best digger available, multiple diggers don't stack
			- abilities: multiple copies of an Ability (such as Sprinting) don't stack
			- entrancement: cannot affect you when you are already entranced
		- monster effects
			- morale effects: all add together
			- temporary effects: add new duration to the existing duration
	- the extra deep monsters generated during the escape now come from a wider range of levels
		- to add more variety to the escape
	- you no longer gain double experience for finding artefacts and unique monsters
		- it was a bit unnecessary...
	- removed the 'crown' screen at the end of the game
		- it was left-over from Angband and seemed out of place
		- if enough people want something like that, perhaps a better version could be added

- Dungeon
	- more stairs on the really big levels
	- more chance that a shaft is placed instead of a stair
	- these things should make the escape a bit faster

- bugfixes
	- chests weren't generating their contents properly
	- minor changes to some vaults to stop generating chests in locations where their items would disappear
	- off-hand weapons were using the wrong damage sides when making a charge attack
	- the boots of Irime now give the right self-knowledge text
	- when extra deep monsters are generated on a level in the pursuit, this no longer includes territorial ones
	- you can no longer see what items a creature is standing on if you detect it with staff of foes or listen
	- you can no longer see what items a creature is carrying unless you can see its square directly
	- monsters that can't use stairs will no longer try to flee to them
	- fixed the problem in debug mode where looking at newly generated monsters could print garbage strings
	- fixed the game taking a turn when declining to attack during the 'truce'
	- fixed the game taking a turn when you aborted an attempt to blow a horn (via mpa-sil)
	- fixed the game giving a turn of poison/regeneration/etc when you save via Control-X (!)
	- fixed a bug with two-weapon fighting where the off-hand penalty was only (-2) (via mpa-sil)
	- fixed a bug with removing autoinscriptions from one item type accidentally removing all of them (via mpa-sil)
	- off-hand weapon weight was counting for heavy armour use (via mpa-sil)
	- Feanorian lamps and lesser jewels granting brightness now auto-identify properly


- Sil 1.1.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- abilities
	- Stun has been removed
		- it was the least interesting melee ability and makes way for a new one:
	- Momentum is a new Melee ability
		- it allows you to use your strength to full effect on lighter melee weapons
		- it works by doubling the effective weapon weight for the purposes of capping the str bonus
	- Cruel Blow and Crippling Shot now allow the monster to make a Will check to avoid the effect
		- the difficulty is 4 times your level of critical hit
		- you can now trigger these on a level one critical hit, but have more chance for higher levels
		- it is a lot easier to trigger these against low Will enemies
	- Knock Back now has a different trigger
		- you now roll a skill roll of your strength*2 vs your opponents con*2
			- you get the effective strength modifiers from charge, rapid attack etc
			- you get a +4 bonus for wielding you weapon with two hands
		- Giants, Morgoth etc are now quite a bit harder to knock back, and small things are easy
	- Opportunist now lets you have one last blow as an enemy tries to flee through the stairs
		- very satisfying if you slay them and get their items

- combat system
	- simplified the limits on how many damage sides your strength can add
		- now it is always a limit equal to the weapon weight in pounds
			- so any 4 lb item can have up to 4 bonus damage sides from strength
		- used to be a side per 0.5 lb for thrown weapons and per 1.5 lb for two handed weapons
		- this will make Charge go better with two handed weapons again
		- it will also make throwing daggers and axes a bit less good again
			- if they are too bad we can revisit this with some extra bonus

- display
	- renamed "Long Corslets" to "Hauberks" (a term used occasionally in the works of Tolkien)
	- fixed some minor anachronisms in artefact and monster descriptions
		- including renaming Earendil's bow as he didn't have it at the time of Sil
	- new automatic notes for
		- falling through false floors
		- falling through trapped stairs
		- encountering uniques for the first time
	- {special} item types you know about are now displayed in the object knowledge menu
		- useful for narrowing down the options when you find a new {special} item

- interface
	- allowed 't' to select closest/target when aiming
		- makes throwing a little bit easier as you can leave a finger on the 't' key
		- just as you can with 'f' and firing
		- (note for keypad users: '5' also works)

- dungeon
	- decreased the chance of trapped stairs during the ascent
	- made Glyphs of Warding harder for monsters to break
		- they used to require a successful monster Will check against difficulty 17
		- now against difficulty 20
			- this is very hard
			- the first creature that can break it at all is Delthaur at 700 ft
		- I encourage people to try to exploit these and see if they are too good

- monsters
	- Silent Watchers can no longer keep you permanently knocked out
		- the maximum amount of time they will knock you out for is 5 turns
		- this is how it was always meant to be
		- sorry to those who never regained consciousness! 
	- Balrogs now drop an extra item when slain
	- Shadow mold spores were treated as mixed elemental (dark) damage in some parts of the code and pure in others
		- this resulted in some misleading info in the hit rolls window
		- I've moved them to simply do mixed elemental damage
			- i.e. an extra die when you are not-resistant
			- it would have been much harder to make them the only melee pure elemental attack

- songs
	- bonuses from songs can now never be negative
	- the Song of Este now always at least doubles your regeneration

- items
	- changed bow damage from (1d7), (1d9), (2d7) into (1d7), (2d5), (3d3)
		- now very similar to the swords
		- should make extreme archery against Morgoth less powerful
	- made Dragon-horn Longbows twice as common as before
	- staffs of light appear earlier, where they might be a bit more useful
	- staffs of sanctity are a touch more likely to appear deeper in the dungeon
	- lesser jewels appear earlier and no longer break when thrown
	- moved Galvorn Armour from [-1, 2d4] to [-1, 1d8] to be more different to Mithril Corslets

- {special} items
	- spider-slaying weapons now also glow if a web is (very) near

- artefacts
	- added:
		- The Mithril Helm of Ecthelion (for Psi)
		- The Kite Shield of the Swan
		- The Hauberk of Nevrast
		- The Boots of Irime
		- The Mail Corslet of Gundor
	- modified:
		- The Shortbow of Celegorm
		- The Spear of Ogbar
		- The Great Axe of Nogrod
	- made some artefacts about 50% rarer:
		- The Corslet of Fingon
		- The Robe of Idril
		- The Hauberk of Maedhros

- removed tridents
	- they weren't useful and weren't really used in combat in Beleriand

- bug fixes
	- many monsters were having occasional trouble with doors due to a subtle off by one error
	- the Polearm Mastery bonus attack couldn't trigger Knock Back properly
		- this should now be a powerful combination
	- sometimes guaranteed good or great items (particularly greaves) were failing to become {special}
	- feanorian lamps of brightness and lesser jewels of brightness didn't glow enough on the ground
	- wielding a proficient weapon (e.g. axes for dwarves) used to give a bonus to throwing a different weapon

- platform specific
	- linux version
		- changing the fonts or gamma in the silx file should now work properly in X11

- Sil 1.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- broke savefile compatibility

- getting silmarils
	- it is now easier to cut out the first Silmaril
	- your weapon can now break on either the second or the third Silmaril
	- you no longer suffer the rapid attack penalties when cutting if you have that ability active

- elemental damage
	- for pure elemental damage (breaths and things as opposed to melee with elements)
		- you now get your resistance before your protection roll
		- used to be the other way around
		- you have always only had a limited amount of prot for such attacks
			- e.g. rings of prot, hardiness, song of staying, (& shields for fire/cold)
			- now these sources of prot actually matter a bit when you have resistance
	- added elemental vulnerabilities
		- these are very rare, and they lower your resistance by one level
		- if it is a level below no resistance, you take double damage, then triple etc.

- monsters
	- many changes, including the following...
	- balrogs:
		- added five more, giving a full complement of seven
		- they are rare, but *very* dangerous
	- giants:
		- lowered perception substantially
		- changed the colours, and flavour text and a few stats for Nan and Gilim
	- orcs:
		- improved Boldog's melee and damage by 1
		- improved Orcobal's melee and damage by 1
		- corrected 'Othrond' to 'Othrod'
			- not sure where that mistake came from!
			- gave him an extra 1 to melee to compensate him for the indignity
	- cats:
		- lowered cat warrior health by 2d4 (20%)
		- lowered Umuiyan's health by 1d4, to put him into the progression
		- moved Umuiyan from shortbow (1d7) to longbow (1d9)
		- improved the archery score of cat assassins by 2
		- lowered will substantially
	- wolves:
		- minor modifications of attack and evasion to put them into a unified pattern
		- lowered the non-unique's health across the board (to 6d4, 8d4, 10d4, 12d4, 14d4)
		- increased the health of Gorthaur and Carcharoth
		- increased the damage of Gorthaur
		- lowered the armour of wargs (from [2d4] to [1d4])
	- trolls:
		- increased health and melee slightly
		- lowered will and perception substantially
	- insects/centipedes:
		- unified health to 2d4
			- a decrease for centipedes and dragonflies
			- an increase for hummerhorns
			- these creatures gain their defence from evasion/prot rather than health
			- (also worth noting: bats are 2d4 as well, birds are 1d4)
	- spiders:
		- increased the melee and damage of Ancient Spider attacks
		- increased the melee and damage of Ungoliant's attacks
		- increased the health of most late-game spiders

		- increased Maeglin's melee and evasion
	- serpents:
		- added slightly erratic movement to all of them (25% chance)
		- ancient serpents
			- removed the elemental auras
				- they were a bit confusing and too easy to force monsters to take damage
			- now have [6d4] instead of [7d4]
			- do an extra 2d4 breath damage do compensate
	- dragons:
		- can no longer make you forget the map
		- this ability is now unique to Mewlips
	- valar:
		- increased Morgoth's will and perception after you knock his crown off
			- due to him taking you more seriously as a threat
				- and the need to challenge you!
	- stone creatures no longer destroy staircases if they die on top of them
	- Shadows and Hithraukar now pass under closed doors
		- Shadows no longer pass through walls

	  if they are woken up by the first attack

		- you cannot be entranced if you haven't had a turn since last entranced
	- fixed a message bug when throwing potions

- stealth
	- monsters can now become less alert if they are out of sight and fail a check to spot you by more than 30
		- they lose a point of alertness for every point more than 30 that they fail by
		- they won't fall asleep though
	- Vanish is now implemented as a +10 bonus to this check

- abilities
	- Vanish: see above
	- you can no longer get an Opportunist attack when knocking a monster back
	- you now stop singing a song if you remove an item which was granting you that ability
	- Charge has been made quite a bit weaker, and also more interesting
		- it was by some distance the most overpowered ability, and should still be good
		- it no longer doubles your weapon dice
		- instead, your attack counts as if you have +3 Dex and +3 Str
			- a bit like an opposite of rapid attack
		- the ideal weapon for charging will thus be heavier than the ideal for normal attacks 
		- also charge no longer works if you are moving slowly (at speed 1)
	- Zone of Control, Opportunist, Flanking, Controlled Retreat
		- no longer work on unwary monsters or monsters during the 'truce'
		- as this was almost always not what the player wanted
	- a few fixes to Exchange Places
		- can no longer be done unless the creature is visible (removes exploits)
		- can no longer be done from within a web/pit
		- now triggers traps if you end up in one
	- Blocking now always works against all ranged attacks (fire breath, arrows, boulders etc)
		- thanks to Angloki for the idea
		- it still requires you to pass to get the bonus against melee attacks
		- it is also now an alternate pre-requisite for controlled retreat
	- fixed some oddities in the build up of the bonus to attack for Concentration
		- i.e. it didn't work for certain free attacks you made in the opponent's turn
		- now it builds the bonus by +1 if you made at least one attack since the start of your last turn
	- Song of Aule now gives a bonus of Song/4 instead of Song/5
		- who says we're just trying to make smithing less good?
	- Crippling Shot now no longer works on critical resistant monsters

- smithing
	- made forges appear a bit more regularly throughout the dungeon
		- this should help a lot in avoiding games with too few forges
	- increased the cost of the 'speed' attribute from 25 to 30 (at Psi's suggestion!)
	- increased the cost of stat points by 20% (the base has moved from 10 to 12)
	- increased the cost of damage sides by 25% (from 12 to 15)
	- increased the cost of brands, slays, sharpness
	- no longer get any benefits for putting penalties on items
		- it seemed cool, but just lead to them being put on Gloves of Smithing an the like
		- the one exception is Danger, which leads to quite a large difficulty reduction (-5)
	- there is now a discount of 20% on the difficulties of robes, crowns, sceptres
		- they now make good artefacts...
	- you can now make all special item types including the bad ones
	- the first forge is now guaranteed to be a normal forge with three charges
		- to avoid the temptation to start-scum
	- you are now asked to confirm spending points of smithing when making a masterpiece

		- if your protection was higher than the earthquake damage
	- staffs of self-knowledge now show attributes of your off-hand weapon (if any)
	- dropped permanent lights now glow properly (at some point this stopped working)
	- chest contents generation slightly simplified (more chance of jewellery now)
	- removed halberds
		- while undeniably cool, they are more a late medieval swiss weapon
		- there are still glaives (which are mentioned in Tolkien) and Celebrist is now one
		- changed the glaive stats to halfway between the old Glaive and Halberd
	- renamed: 'leather gloves' to 'gloves', 'leather boots' to 'boots', 'steel greaves' to 'greaves'
	- removed rings of attention/wrath
		- enough wrath items already, especially with our other changes
	- removed amulet of danger
		- same reason, and there is a new cursed replacement amulet...
	- removed rings of True Sight
		- there are enough other True Sight types
	- improved Mithril Helms and Mithril Greaves
		- now all mithril items are better in at least one combat attribute
		- not merely weight and ignoring acid

- {special} items
	- adjusted the depths and rarities across the board
	- added several new special item types, including cursed ones
	- made some large changes to the special items types
		- changed the single type slaying items (Orc Slaying etc)
			- most now slay two types of monster and are named for a place
			- Final Rest instead has Free Action on it
			- note that 'of Gondolin' now refers to the orc/troll weapon
				- since the blades from Gondolin in the books glowed when orcs were near
				- the old 'of Gondolin' weapons are no more, though 'of Nargothrond' is similar
		- removed (Avenger)
			- though there is a new artefact shortsword with riposte
		- added a sticky curse to (Vampiric)
		- removed 'of Brilliance'
			- these were introduced before slaying weapons glowed and it is inelegant to have both
		- removed Boots of Slowness
			- just too nasty
		- removed Gloves of Agility
			- special gloves were too similar to rings
		- removed Gloves of Clumsiness
		- changed Gloves of Weakness to Gloves of Treachery
			- now with a nice bonus...
		- changed name of Gloves of Power to Gloves of Strength
		- added Gloves of Swordplay
			- to compete with Gloves of Strength
	- fixed a bug where some special weapons wielded from the floor wouldn't glow properly
	- fixed the auto-identification of lanterns of brightness when refuelling them
	- unified the True Sight types of helms and light sources
		- so identifying one identifies them all
		- this had slipped past me before

- artefacts
	- added 21 new artefacts
	- realised that quite a few of the artefact weapons were just too crazy and toned them back
	- added descriptions for those artefacts which didn't have them
	- set Calris aflame like all good Balrog swords should be, and made other changes to it
		- we think it is really strong now and people are crazy not to be using it more...

- dungeon
	- added some T-intersections in the corridors
	- fixed two bugs in dungeon generation which could lead to doubled and tripled doors
	- no rubble generated before 200 ft anymore

- traps
	- made false floors half as common as other traps
	- webs can no longer be generated in dead ends

- food
	- it is now harder to get gorged (so it can't happen unless already 'full')
	- the gorged effect wears off even faster

- interface
	- added an onscreen main menu with all the interface commands
		- it can be accessed with (m) or (Escape)
			- the latter can be turned off if you find it annoying
		- I intend this to be the main way to access many of these commands
			- and in future versions I will remove direct access to some:
				- e.g. Colours, Macros, Knowledge, Options, ...
				- but not Character Sheet, Save, ...
		- comment on the Angband Forum if you have concerns about this
	- added back in the 'auto_more' option
		- (I still wouldn't want to use it though!)
	- stopped it wasting a turn when you try to pick something up and nothing is present
		- also improved some interface oddities surrounding 'pick things up by default'
	- stopped it wasting a turn when you decide not to make anything at a forge
	- fixed bug with being warned about dropping your shield when you wouldn't have to do so
	- added prompt warning you about being forced to drop your two handed weapon when wielding a shield
	- the object knowledge screen now displays potion/herb/staff etc types that you have seen in previous games
		- this is useful for the process of elimination...
	- fixed some interface bugs for smithing:
		- the name of an artefact is no longer reset when returning to the artefact submenu
		- selecting menu options via their letters now works properly

- display
	- the iron crown no longer shows up multiple times in the knowledge menu
	- fixed some issues relating to Morgoth before and after being uncrowned
	- staffs now display how many times they have been used when unidentified

		- including the stats and weight
	- slight modification of messages for failing to tunnel
	- fixed a bug where the player would identify their off-hand weapon when their main weapon struck truly

	- linux version
		- X11 now supports solid block walls and highlighted unwary/sleeping creatures
		- X11 now supports the initial menu and more user friendly loading of characters
		- GCU now makes the map quadrant of its virtual terms as large as possible

	- mac version
		- can now easily open savefiles generated on other platforms (e.g. competition saves)

- challenge modes
	- all of these were buggy!
		- no artefact mode no longer generates monster-specific artefacts
			- like Spear of Boldog etc
		- straight down mode now works correctly
		- disconnected stairs mode now works correctly

- behind the scenes
	- notes are no longer temporarily stored in 'notes files'
	- this should finally put an end to all the problems with these files!
	- fixed some potential bugs in targetting, dungeon generation, hallucination

- thanks
	- thanks go to many of the denizens of angband.oook.cz for their suggestions and bug finding
		- this really does help to improve the game!
	- thanks also go to our wonderful beta test team
		- I have no idea how they played so many games so quickly



- Sil 1.0.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		- throwing items now also fails when afraid

- Sil 1.0.1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- interface
	- corrected the keypad in the (?) screen
	- made Angband-like keyset use (+) instead of (/)
	- brought back the (M) map command due to popular request
	- using torches and lanterns now refuels your current one by default (if you are already wielding one)
		- if you want to swap torches/lanterns, just remove the existing one first
		- it now warns you about overfueling

	- added a 'Score' line to the character dumps to help with the Angband ladder
	- made the combat rolls window more compact and more flexible
	- removed monster health, alertness and morale info for the target if out of sight
	- fixed display of "Mindless"

	- added weights of weapons to character dumps
	- fixed display of dates

		- instead of the new depth you went to from that level
	- adds a small screenshot to character dumps for dead characters

- potion of true sight now gives (temporary) resistance to blindness

- reduced the Will of cat-type creatures
	- making them more vulnerable to being put to sleep/terrified

	- made the Song of Aule cost only 1/3 of a point of voice per turn
	- the Song of Freedom now disarms and unlocks chests

- artefacts
	- some minor changes to rarity and to the artefacts themselves

	- no longer take 100 turns of food and game clock
	- the forcing downwards time limits still avoid the infinite levels problem
	- the 'stair-scumming' problem of going up and down repeatedly is now avoided with trapped stairs
	- trapped stairs
		- there is a chance that the stairs give way beneath you like a trap door / false floor
		- this chance is miniscule or even zero in normal play
		- but it goes up the more you use the stairs in quick succession
		- attempts to stairscum will quickly lead to being injured on a level with no escape 
		- we think this is pretty difficult to abuse..
