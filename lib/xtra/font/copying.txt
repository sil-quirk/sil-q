Thanks to Simon Tatham, author of "dewinfont", which made it much easier to 
extract font information. <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/fonts/>
Also, thanks for his "mkwinfont" program, which made it possible to automate
conversion of the old DOS fonts to the .fon format.

 Software in this distribution of the X Window System is covered by copyrights;
 see the file LABELS in this directory for a list.

 The MIT distribution of the X Window System is publicly available, but is NOT
 in the public domain.  The difference is that copyrights granting rights for
 unrestricted use and redistribution have been placed on all of the software to
 identify its authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to take this software and
 build commerical products.

 Individuals or organizations wishing to contribute software to the public
 releases should use a copyright notice that is no more restrictive than
 the sample given below.  In particular,

     o  Do not place any restictions on what can be done with this software
    (this includes using the GNU "copyleft").

     o  Do not include the words "All rights reserved" unless you have had a
    lawyer verify that you have also explicitly given away all of the
    necessary rights shown in the samples.

     o  Spell out the word "Copyright"; the phrase "(c)" is NOT a legal
    alternative to the c-in-circle symbol.

     o  Put at least a one-line copyright at the top of EVERY source file, if
    not the full copyright.  Also, the copyright line or full notice MUST
    physically appear in each file.  Using the preprocessor to #include the
    copyright from some other file has no legal meaning (it can be used to
    incorporate common strings into the binary, but has no effect on the
    status of the source code).

     o  Things that are copyrighted are, by definition, not in the public
    domain.

 A copyright notice similar to the following is strongly recommended (replacing
 MIT with your organization's name and putting your name and address at the
 bottom).
